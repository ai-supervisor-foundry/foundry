1. Context files in `contexts/` provide detailed project documentation for agents with zero context.
2. Read relevant context file before working on a project (e.g., `contexts/easeclassifieds/frontend.md` for FE work).
3. Context files contain project structure, recent fixes, configuration, and common issues.
4. Update context files when making significant changes to keep them current.
5. Use context files to quickly onboard new agents or understand project state.
