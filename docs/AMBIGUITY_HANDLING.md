# Ambiguity Handling

## Hard Rule: HALT Conditions

If any of the following occur, the supervisor must HALT:

- Cursor output asks a question
- Cursor output proposes alternatives
- Acceptance criteria are partially met
- Output format deviates
- Required artifact is missing

## Rules

- No retries unless operator explicitly instructs.
- Operator input is the only unblock mechanism.
