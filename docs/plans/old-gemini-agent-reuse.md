# Goal I want a plan to be able to: 1. reuse gemini agent chats, 2. Tag them. 3. Resume them on command. 4. Same chat should be re-used for the same task (taskid, or if same feature within). The criteria below should help decide more requirements. 5. New chat should only be restarted after - Three consecutive timeouts / errors occured (linear back-offed) - Context is larger than 350,000 tokens and was compressed and context size is still larger than 50,000 tokens (ONLY if it is possible to see context size, otherwise drop this requirement) 6. Before starting a new chat, list all sessions/chats/agents see if a chat / agent (except the current one ofcourse), within last 1 week matches criteria of what we are doing (name / desc). - Optionally if we can read summary or context as well. (Only proceed with this if POSSIBLE) and only if name/desc match. # Side requirements - Context needs to be compressed after itreaches 350,000 tokens (If possible to check context size) - enhance the task schema (update all docs required as well) to include meta (interface meta { feature: string } ) # Notes - I use session, chat, agent interchangeably. # Docs to use Helper parameter doc [Cursor CLI Params](/docs/plans/helper-docs/gemini-cli-params.md)
