    "description": "A simplified, senior-friendly classifieds super app built with React and Tailwind CSS that aggregates property and vehicle listings into a single, accessible mobile-first experience. The platform combines a robust backend aggregation and scraping system that continuously collects, normalizes, and enriches listings from multiple external sources with a subscription-based daily curated feed that prioritizes relevance, freshness, and user preferences. Featuring phone-only authentication, clear navigation, large readable UI elements, and intelligent search, the system is designed to reduce noise and complexity for end users while delivering a reliable, scalable, and continuously updated marketplace, with the frontend located in ./sandbox/easeclassifieds and the backend and aggregation services in ./sandbox/easeclassifieds-api.",
